# Twitter-Event-Trend-Analysis

-Done for Data Intensive Computing - CSE487

-Use TwitteR package in R to perform EDA and some basic visualization w/o ggplot or ggplot2. Tweet size roughly 2000. Essentially will use twitteR to get a trend and geocode the locations of the tweets and save them to dataframes. Data visualization to plot density heat maps to plot where the tweets come from in the United States.

# Notes

*Make sure you have a Twitter Dev account. I removed API Twitter keys for security reason. You need to replace with your own keys(you need all 4) from your twitter dev account.

*Change the search tag to whatever you want. I just chose lady gaga since it was after Superbowl 51 and she was highly trending.

*Geocoding takes quite a long time.
