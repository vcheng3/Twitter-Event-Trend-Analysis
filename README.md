# Twitter-Event-Trend-Analysis

-Use TwitteR package in R to perform EDA and some basic visualization w/o ggplot or ggplot2. Tweet size roughly 2000.

-Make sure you have a Twitter Dev account, and replace with your own keys(you need all 4). 

-Change the search tag to whatever you want. I just chose lady gaga since it was after Superbowl 51 and she was highly trending.

-Geocoding will take roughly 30 minutes to an hour.
